== ReInstall Gems

This rake task re-installs all your gems, it installs all currently installed versions.

I needed to do this when upgrading to MacOS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) as it is 64 bit
and any compiled gems where compiled for 32 bit.

It only reinstalls gems which make use of C extensions.

"gem pristine -all" did not work for me.

You will have to keep an eye on the output as the task does not log any errors
during install, some uninstalls also include 'questions'.

== Notes

Gems are installed with 'sudo' so you will need to enter your password.

Any gems not avalible via a remote source (rubygems etc.) will be uninstalled,
but not installed. You will need to install these gems manually.

It skips the mysql gem which needs special flags set to compile 64 bit code.
